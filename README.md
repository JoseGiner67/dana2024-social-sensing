# DANA 2024 Social Sensing

This repository contains the core code used in the study **"Harnessing Social Sensing for Real-Time Flood Event Reconstruction: A Digital Autopsy of the 2024 Valencia DANA"**, submitted to *Nature Communications*.

The project integrates geolocated citizen-generated data from X (formerly Twitter) with hydrological and hydraulic models to reconstruct and analyze the 2024 DANA flood event in Valencia, Spain. We apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to extract actionable insights from social media data.

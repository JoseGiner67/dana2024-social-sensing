# DANA 2024 Social Sensing

This repository contains the code used in the study **"Harnessing Social Sensing for Real-Time Flood Event Reconstruction: A Digital Autopsy of the 2024 Valencia DANA"**, submitted to *Nature Communications*.

We reconstruct the 2024 DANA flood event in Valencia (Spain) using citizen-generated data from X (formerly Twitter). The project combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to extract real-time insights and generate structured intelligence to support emergency response.
